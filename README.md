# hello-world
This repository is for all my classwork code and projects

Hello! My name is Nicholas J. Griebel and I am a student at Pima Community College. I am currently majoring in Computer Information Systems, working towards my Programmer Analyst degree. This repository contains code for projects and various work for the class. I am an avid homebrew hobbyist, and I enjoy writing code. I specifically enjoy working on operating system development, as well as compiler design.
